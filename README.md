# FAIR theory: Tripartite Model

# Description

This is a FAIR theory, inspired by the *Tripartite Model* of the impact of the family on children’s emotion regulation and adjustment (Morris et al., 2007.

The tripartite model identifies three major familial influences on children's ER:

1. **Observation (O)**, e.g., modeling parents' behavior
2. **Parenting practices (PP)**, e.g., emotion coaching
3. **Emotional Family Climate (EC)**, e.g., attachment style

These three factors, together with **parent characteristics (PC)** and **child characteristics (CC)**, shape the child's **emotion regulation (ER)**, which in turn influences the child's **adjustment (A)** (e.g., internalizing/externalizing problems, social competence).

I specified this model as a DAG, making several assumptions that differ from the original description in the paper by Morris and colleagues.

# Interoperability

The theory is specified as a DAG, and can be used for causal inference in R using the `dagitty` package.
